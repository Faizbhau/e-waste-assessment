# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

Follow these steps to create a GitHub repository for your E-Waste Component Assessment System:

## 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account (Faizbhau)
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter a repository name (e.g., "e-waste-assessment")
4. Add a description (optional): "AI-powered web application for automated quality assessment of reusable e-waste components"
5. Choose "Public" or "Private" visibility
6. Check "Add a README file" (we've already created one for you)
7. Choose "MIT License" from the "Add a license" dropdown (we've already created a LICENSE file)
8. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Push Your Local Code to GitHub

From your local machine or Replit environment, run the following commands:

```bash
# Initialize a Git repository (if not already initialized)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Add the GitHub repository as a remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/Faizbhau/e-waste-assessment.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Note: You may need to authenticate with GitHub credentials when pushing.
